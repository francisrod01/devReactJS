## Get Started ##

To start this project, you will need to [clone the API][3] to connect to the database. Don't worry about it. It's a simple sqlite file. :smile:

* Start the database with `npm start` on console

```bash
~$ /devreactjs-bootcamp-runs-server
> node index.js

Server running...
```

* Start the dev-running project with `npm start` on console

```bash
~$ npm start
> dev-running@0.1.0 start /home/paneladm/projects/dev-running

Starting the development server...
```
