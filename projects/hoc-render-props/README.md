Working with Higher-Order Components (HOC)

- Author: [Francis Rodrigues][1]

## Concepts ##

### React ###

React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

### Higher-Order Component ###

> A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.

Concretely, `a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component`.
